Later versions of the Ettools package will feature localization.  The below
illustrates the direction I'll be going in unless advised otherwise.



Convert::
::Ethiopic       # Perl XS module to the libeth library.
  ::System       # Returns System objects for conversion requests
  ::Cstocs       # String & File conversion between charsets.
  ::Time         # Time conversion services.
  ::Names        # Map English transcribed names back onto Ethiopic string.



Lingua::
