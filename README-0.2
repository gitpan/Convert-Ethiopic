This is the development release for the next Convert-Ethiopic.
As such not all classes and methods are fully implemented and
services may be unreliable.  This version is the basis for
Zobel-0.20 which is complete and underdoing testing.

Module documentation (POD) has not been updated.

The inter for the Number, String, File and date classes
are fairly similar.  If Convert::Ethiopic::System "in"
and "out" handles are passed when the respective classes
are instantiated, they will be used.  If not the default
input system is assumed to be "SERA" and the default
output system is assumed to be "UTF8".  This will be
configurable in the final release.

Examine the bin/ scripts for usage.
